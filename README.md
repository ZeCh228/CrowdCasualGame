# Crowd Runner Prototype
A creative prototype where you control a crowd of hand-drawn characters that must navigate obstacles and reach the finish line.

## üé• About the Game
(Consider adding a link to the gameplay video here)

In this prototype, you play as a crowd of characters that follow a leader. The crowd must avoid obstacles along the way, and if the leader dies, the next closest character becomes the new leader.

## Project Status
üöß **Project Status**: Unfinished
‚ùå **Further Development**: Not planned

## üìå Main Objective
This prototype was developed as a test assignment for a job application. The goal was to approach the development creatively, with no strict guidelines or limitations.

## Features Implemented
**Crowd Behavior**: Built a leader-based system where the crowd follows the leader, and the closest member becomes the new leader if the leader dies.
**Hand-Drawn Art**: All game graphics were created manually by me.
‚è±Ô∏è **Development Time**: Approximately 10-12 hours.

## Challenges and Limitations
Since this project was developed under tight time constraints, there are some limitations:

**Architecture**: The project has structural issues due to the rushed development process.
**Visual Artifacts**: Some characters and dice have a white background, affecting the aesthetics.
**Unfinished Features**: Lacks sound, animation, and particle effects, which were not completed within the time limit.
